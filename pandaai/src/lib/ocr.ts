This is a demonstration of OCR text extraction. In a real implementation, this would contain the actual text extracted from your PDF document.

1. Convert PDF pages to images
2. Use Tesseract.js to extract text from each image
3. Combine all extracted text into a single result

For now, this is a placeholder that shows how the OCR extraction would work. The actual implementation would extract the real content from your uploaded PDF.

Please note: This is a demonstration. In production, you would see the actual text content extracted from your PDF document.`;
